2. Reclamation
| As the authors of this repository, we assure that all action in creating and coding on these problems were accepted or allowed by the Tutors about using related |reference and so on. Of course, the Gale Shapley algorithm was also being used wisely on the Internet, we have customised the algorithm to fit it to the specific |problem that we have to deal with. All the code inside were created by ourselves and the only purpose is to deal with the problems that mentioned above.

3. Problem description
| As the extension of the Stable Marriage Problem, the problems in the project also related to the Matching Theory. Same as to Stable Marriage Problem, the problems, |School Registration and Human Resource management are defined as the problem about matching players together that gain the highest score of satisfaction of the players |that the connection could not be broken.

4. Code review
| - The source code and input sample was put inside folder examples/ custom.
| - The code in this project was not completed yet, so it still contains alot of bugs and also not be optimized yet.
| - The pseudo code was putted inside the source too.
